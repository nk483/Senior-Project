# Senior-Project
The purpose of this repo is to allow readers to replicate the results of my senior project. The initial raw data file is stored in combined_df.parquet,
in the data_processing folder. The processed data that I do my computations on is processed_df.parquet and process_df.py is the python file that 
transforms combined_df.paruet into processed_df.parquet. The data analysis python scripts are all in the main folder and their figure outputs are
in the figures folder.
